\frametitle{Conclusions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
            \item Good behavior of GSP comparison a SPS.
            \item The quality of solutions found by GSP is comparable with the
            quality of solutions found by SPS.
            \item Coalition Formation problem can approximate the results
            of a set partion problem in less time complexity.
        \end{itemize}
        Because we are focused on a {\bf centralized coordinator} in the future works we want to
        perform a {\bf distributed coordiantion}.

        That strategy should be more {\bf flessible}, {\bf adaptive} at the situation on the traveling
        orders then {\bf fault-tolenace}.
