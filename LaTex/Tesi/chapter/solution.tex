In this section I propose the approaches with centralized coordination.
The first strategy, mentioned above, is the CGS1:1 which consider only 
one task allocated for one robot.
The second strategy extends the first, the main concept of this strategy 
is merging the tasks for optimaze the capacity of robot.

\section{Greedy Strategy Single robot : Single task (GS1:1)}





\section{Set Partition Strategy Single robot : Multiple task (SPS1:N)}





\section{Coalition formation Strategy Single robot : Multiple task (CFS1:N)}
