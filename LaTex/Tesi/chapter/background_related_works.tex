In this section, we detail the main issues for \mrs coordination 
in industrial domains, then we provide a detailed discussion on coordination
approaches, highlighting challenges and main solution techniques.

\section{Multi-Robot System for Logistics Applications}
In this thesis we focus on industrial scenarios where robots have a high
degree of autonomy and operate in a dynamic environment.
\\
In article \cite{maxsum} robots must cooperate to maximizes the number of packages
completed in the unit of time. To this end a crucial component is to avoid interferences
when moving in the enviroment. They have formalised that problem as a Distributed 
Constrained Optimization problem based their solution on the binary max-sum algorithm.
\\
The most recent paper in logistic scenario \cite{mapd}, uses a Token Passing approach 
that solves the pickup-and-delivery tasks. The resulting algorithm takes kinematic 
constraints during planning, computes continuos agent movements with given velocities
that work on non-holonomic robots.

In this work, we consider a similar setting where a set of robots are involved
in trasportations tasks for logistics. However, we focus on the specific problem
of task assignment.

\section{Coordination in Multi-Robot Systems}
Coordination for \mrs has been investigated from several diverse
perspectives and nowadays, there is a wide range of techniques that can be used to 
orchestrate the actions and movements of robots operationg in the same enviroment.
Specifically, the ability to effectively coordinate the actions of a \mrs is a key 
requirement in several applications domains that range from disaster response to 
environmental monitoring, militaty operations, manufacturing and logistics. 
In all such domains, coordination has been addressed using various frameworks and 
techniques and there are several survery papers dedicated to categorize such different
approaches and identifying most prominent issues when developing \mrs.
\\
In the paper \cite{cooros} present and evaluate new ROS package for coordinated 
multi-robot exploration. The packages allow completely distributed control and do 
not rely on (but allow) central controllers.
\\
Robotics systems may range from simple sensors, acquiring and processing data, to 
complex human-like machines, able to interact with the enviroment in fairly complex way. 
Moreover, it is not easy to give a definition of the level of autonomy that is required 
for a robot in order to be considered an entity acting in the enviroment, as opposed 
to a simple machine that provides services to the operator.
From an engineering standpoint,
the \mrs can improve the effectiveness of a robotic system either from the viewpoint 
of the performance in accomplishing
certain tasks, or in the robustness and reliability of the system,
which can be increased by modularization.
In fact, \mrs are useful not only when the robots can accomplishing different functions, but 
also when they have the same capabilities. Even when a single robot can achieve the given task,
the possibility of deploying a team of robots can improve the performance of the overall system.
Another significant development of \mrs is technological improvements both in the 
hardware and in the associated software are two of the key reasons beyond the growing
interest in \mrs. The increased availability of complex sensor devices and robotic platforms
in the research laboratories favored their development and customization, resulting
in robots equipped with reliable and effective hardware that improves their basic 
capabilities. In addiction, the software techniques developed for the robotic applications
take advantage of the hardware improvements and provide complex and reliable solutions for the basic 
tasks that a robot should be able to perform, while acting in real world environments:
localization, path planning, object trasportation, object recognition and tracking, etc.

% frase finale
Given our focus on logistic scenarios, here we restrict our attention to coordination
approaches based on optimization and specifically on task assignment as this the most 
common framework for my reference application domain.
