In this thesis we have shown how our system can perform pickup-and-delivery tasks.
We evaluate the performance of our system in a realistic simulation enviroment,
precisely on the ICE Laboratory build with ROS and stage. 
In particular we compared our task assignment approches with the baseline greedy 
approch.

We have discovered that a coalition formation problem can approximate the results 
of a set partion problem in less time complexity.

Because we are focused on a centralized coordinator in the future works we want to 
perform a distributed coordiantor using a recent stategy studied before to implement 
our approaches.
In more detail on \cite{mapd} they used a Token Passing strategy with kinematic 
constraints but consider only one task assigned to one robot at time.
We want to extend this limitations considering the possibility of assigning more 
tasks in one travel.
That strategy should be more flessible, adaptive at the situation on the traveling
orders then fault-tolenace. 

The scope set at the beginning of the thesis have been reached.
The results comfirmed the expectations. 

Then in coclusion the \gsp algorithm aproximate the \sps strategy on the same task set,
calculating the solution in polynomial time complexity.
